 âœ•  Symfony 2.3.27 was successfully installed but your system doesn't meet its
     technical requirements! Fix the following issues before executing
     your Symfony application:

 * date.timezone setting must be set
   > Set the "date.timezone" setting in php.ini* (like Europe/Paris).

 After fixing these issues, re-check Symfony requirements executing this command:

   php my_project/app/check.php

 Then, you can:

    * Change your current directory to /home/gallemand/git/lbbf/LeagueManager/symfony_test/my_project

    * Configure your application in app/config/parameters.yml file.

    * Run your application:
        1. Execute the php app/console server:run command.
        2. Browse to the http://localhost:8000 URL.

    * Read the documentation at http://symfony.com/doc
